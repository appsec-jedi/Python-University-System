# Python University System
## Three small Django apps which work together to store university, department, and student models.
## Students belong to departments and departments belong to universities. All three applications are self-contained but work with the other two.
## Users can create an account and store university, department, and student models. Each user can only see the data they created.
## University models can be exported to csv
## Django Web App built with Python
